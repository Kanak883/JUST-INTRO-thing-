Hey everyone, it's a pleasure to be here today sharing a bit about myself. I go by the name Kanak Bodkhe, and I'm just an 18-year-old with big dreams. Bhopal is where I call home, and I'm currently navigating the exhilarating journey of my first year in college. I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering at Bansal College of Engineering, Mandideep.

But hey, there's more to me than just textbooks and code! Beyond the lecture halls and labs, I find immense joy in capturing the beauty of nature through my trusty camera lens. I'm that guy who's always tinkering with photography software on his Android phone, trying to squeeze out the best shot possible.

Besides all things tech and photography, I'm an unabashed bookworm. I lose myself in the world of light novels and Japanese mangas, where stories have the power to transport us to entirely different realms.

As for my journey so far, it's been peppered with little victories. Back in school, I was the go-to person for organizing annual functions and making assemblies memorable. Oh, and did I mention I clinched the top spot in the National Science Olympiad for Mathematics at the city level and made my mark at the state level in English?

Academically, I've held my own, scoring a solid 78% in my 10th-grade exams and a respectable 63% in my 12th-grade exams at Maharishi Vidya Mandir, Ratanpur, Bhopal.

Deep down, I'm just a tech enthusiast, a problem-solving junkie, and a relentless explorer of all things digital. My ultimate ambition? To become a software engineer and UI designer, crafting user experiences that are nothing short of magical across all operating systems.

Thanks for lending an ear as I share a piece of my journey with all of you today.
